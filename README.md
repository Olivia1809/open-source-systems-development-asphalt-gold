Description
The Peer Tutoring Platform is a web-based system designed to connect students with peer tutors for academic support. It provides a collaborative space where students can seek help with their studies, and peer tutors can offer guidance, share knowledge, and assist with academic challenges. This platform aims to make academic resources more accessible, promote collaborative learning, and create a community-driven approach to education.

Key Features
• Student and Tutor Accounts: Separate user accounts for students and tutors with unique privileges and features.
• Session Booking: Students can view tutor profiles, check availability, and book one-on-one or group tutoring sessions.
• Subject and Course Catalog: A searchable catalog that allows students to find tutors by subject or specific courses.
• Review and Rating System: After sessions, students can leave feedback for tutors, helping maintain quality and reliability.
• Messaging System: Integrated messaging for students and tutors to discuss session details, ask preliminary questions, and clarify topics.
• Admin Dashboard: For administrators to monitor platform activity, manage user accounts, and generate reports.

Benefits
• Academic Collaboration: Encourages students to support each other, fostering a sense of community and shared learning.
• Accessible Academic Help: Connects students with peer tutors quickly and conveniently, improving academic performance and confidence.
• Skill Development: Tutors enhance their knowledge and communication skills, while students gain clarity on challenging topics.
• Community Engagement: Builds a collaborative academic environment and a sense of responsibility among peers.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:
• Git (for version control)
• XAMPP
• Visual studio code

Installation

1. Clone the Repository (First-Time Setup)
   If you haven’t cloned the repository to your local machine yet, start by cloning it:
   bash
   git clone <repository-url>

   Replace <repository-url> with the repository’s GitHub URL. This command creates a local copy of the repository on your computer.

2. Navigate to the Repository Folder
   Move into the project directory:
   bash
   cd <repository-name>
3. Create a New Branch for Your Feature
   Before making any changes, create a new branch named after the feature or task you’re working on. This keeps your changes isolated until they’re ready to merge with the main branch:
   bash
   git checkout -b <feature-branch-name>

Replace <feature-branch-name> with a descriptive name, such as add-login-feature or fix-bug-123. This will create and switch to the new branch.

4. Pull Latest Changes from GitHub (Optional)
   To make sure your branch is up-to-date, you can pull the latest changes from the main branch before starting:
   bash
   git pull origin main
5. Make Your Changes
   Edit or add your code as needed for the feature you’re working on.

6. Stage Your Changes
   After modifying or adding files, stage them:
   bash
   git add <file-name>

You can add all modified files at once:
bash
git add .

7. Commit Your Changes
   Once staged, commit the changes with a descriptive message:
   bash
   git commit -m "Implemented login feature"

8. Push Your Feature Branch to GitHub
   To share your feature branch with the remote repository on GitHub, push it up:
   bash
   git push origin <feature-branch-name>

   Replace <feature-branch-name> with the name of your branch.

9. Open a Pull Request (PR)
   After pushing your branch, go to the repository on GitHub and open a Pull Request (PR) from your feature branch to the main branch. This step allows others to review your code before merging it into the main branch.
